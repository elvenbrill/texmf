# Details per file setting:
# text    These files should be normalized (i.e. convert CRLF to LF).
# binary  These files are binary and should be left untouched.

# Auto detect
# Handle line endings automatically for files detected as
# text and leave all files detected as binary untouched.
# This will handle all files NOT defined below.
