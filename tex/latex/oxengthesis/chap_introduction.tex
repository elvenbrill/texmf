\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapter:introduction}

It is widely reported, notably by the World Health Organisation \cite{stroetmann2010can}, that global changes in population demographics, the increased incidence of chronic diseases and the unmet needs for more personalised care are trends that need new integrated approaches to health and social care.

\section{Monitoring of vital signs}

The standard vital signs include temperature, \af{hr}, \af{rr}, blood pressure and, when appropriate, \af{spo2}. The routine measurement and interpretation of these vital signs is a core component of the physiological assessment of most patients \cite{prior1977physical,goldberg2005practical}, as they can provide critical information about the underlying state of their health. Finding reliable correspondences in two images of a scene taken from arbitrary viewpoints viewed with possibly different cameras and in different illumination conditions is a difficult and critical step towards fully automatic reconstruction of 3D scenes\cite{hartley2003multiple}.
